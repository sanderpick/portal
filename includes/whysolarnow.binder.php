					<strong><span style="font-size: 112%">Why</span></strong> solar?
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe that a commitment to developing a variety of renewable energy sources including solar are essential to solving America’s energy problems. Solar energy can be the most cost effective source of renewable energy for powering your home or business.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>The Benefits of Solar</strong> are clear:<br><br>
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<h3><span style="color: #86CB00;">Clean.</span></h3>
						<p>
							Emissions from generating electricity are toxic to our environment as well as the single largest contributor to global warming. According to NREL, the average residential solar energy system saves roughly 100 tons of CO2; the equivalent of planting 67 trees.<br><br>
						</p>
						<h3><span style="color: #86CB00;">Economical.</span></h3>
						<p>
							Investing in a solar system is a hedge against rising energy prices and allows you to fix the cost of your energy in today’s dollars.<br><br>
						</p>
						<h3><span style="color: #86CB00;">Homegrown.</span></h3>
						<p>
							Energy independence is a critical priority for our country. Solar energy lets us make the energy we need here in America while creating jobs and fueling economic growth.<br><br>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					<strong><span style="font-size: 112%">Why</span></strong> now?
				</p>
				<p>
					Rising energy prices, global warming and dependence on oil are just a few reasons why solar energy is the right choice today.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solar energy allows for home and business owners to make an immediate contribution to positive change. Unlike other sources of power, solar energy systems can be installed at almost any location bringing the source of energy directly to the customer.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Solar Energy</strong> makes economic sense:<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Economies of scale in product supply and improved methods of installation have contributed to lower pricing in solar energy systems. Additionally, the advent of grid-tied systems that do not rely on battery storage have also made solar more affordable. These changes, coupled with rising energy costs, are reasons why solar energy makes economic sense.
