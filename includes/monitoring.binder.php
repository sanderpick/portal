				<h3><strong>Light</strong>gauge</h3><br />
				<strong>Light</strong>gauge is a powerful tool offered by <strong>Lighthouse</strong>solar for its customers to monitor the production of their photovoltaic systems and the energy consumption of their home or business. Customers are able to access the data either through their own web portal or without an internet connection through a local area network.<br><br />
				<strong>Light</strong>gauge updates every second for real-time monitoring and can store thirty years worth of data in its solid state memory. <strong>Light</strong>gauge can be configured to monitor specific individual loads, such as a hot tub, water heater, machinery, a sub-panel or other electrical load that may be of interest. Specific loads can be tracked individually to get an accurate view of the total energy usage.<br><br />
				<strong>Light</strong>gauge installs in minutes in most cases and requires no maintenance or subscriptions. By making the electricity consumed in your home or business visible on your computer screen, the abstract understanding of electrical usage becomes tangible and manageable.
